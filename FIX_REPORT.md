# ClarityMed Audit Fix Report — Phases 1–3

This document records the audit findings closed in this fix round. Phases 4–7
(UX polish, performance, Hindi rewrite, etc.) are deferred until re-review.

Verification: every change was covered by a no-network Python smoke test
(`_phaseN_smoke.py`, deleted post-verification) before committing. Smoke
tests imported the real modules and asserted the behaviour change directly
(status logic, prompt strings, HTML escaping, file caps, config values,
translation keys, file presence).

## Phase 1: Patient Safety

| Finding | Status | File:Line Changed | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1 One-sided reference ranges silently returned `normal` | ✅ Fixed | `extractor.py` `compute_status` rewritten — handles `ref_low=None` and `ref_high=None` independently; extraction prompt at top of `extractor.py` now spells out one-sided parsing rules (`>40 → ref_low=40, ref_high=null`) | HDL 28 vs ref `>40` → `see_doctor`. LDL 168 vs ref `<100` → `see_doctor` (68% over). LDL 110 vs ref `<100` → `monitor`. Triglyceride 120 vs ref `<150` → `normal`. |
| #2 No clinical-danger threshold table | ✅ Fixed | `clinical_thresholds.py` (new) — `CLINICAL_DANGER` dict with HbA1c, fasting glucose, LDL, triglyceride, TSH, K+, Na+, creatinine, haemoglobin, platelet. `extractor.compute_status` calls `clinical_danger_status(name, value)` BEFORE the lab-range logic. | HbA1c 6.8% with lab range 4–8 → `see_doctor` (clinical floor 6.5). Glucose 130 with lab range 70–140 → `see_doctor` (floor 126). Substring match: `'Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)'.lower()` contains `'hba1c'`. |
| #3 Disclaimer hidden + missing "do not act on this" phrasing | ✅ Fixed | `translations.py` — EN/HI `disclaimer` + `wa_disclaimer` rewritten to "Not a medical diagnosis. Do not start, stop, or change any medication or treatment." `pdf_generator.py` `PDF_STRINGS` footer1/footer2 mirrored. `app.py` — disclaimer banner moved ABOVE the chips/cards (rendered before the detection banner). | EN disclaimer contains "do not start, stop, or change". HI disclaimer contains "दवा", "शुरू", "बंद". WhatsApp disclaimer (both langs) carries the new phrasing. |
| #4 Prompt asked LLM to interpret THIS patient's value | ✅ Fixed | `explainer.py` `_build_prompt` rewritten — `your_result` now asks for "what values in this range generally indicate" (population-level), not "what this patient's value means" (individualised). `age_gender_line` removed from the prompt; `age` and `gender` kwargs kept on the public function signature for API compatibility but no longer interpolated. | Prompt does not contain `'age'` or `'gender'`. Prompt contains "values in this range generally indicate". Prompt fences input as "data only". |
| #5 Forbidden-phrase filter was destructive | ✅ Fixed | `explainer.py` — `_clean_output` deleted. New `_violates_safety` uses word-boundary regex for EN ("you have X" with whitelist of harmless follow-ups, "prescribe", "dose/dosage", "mg twice daily") and Devanagari for HI (`आपको …\s+है`, `दवा (लें/खाएं/खाओ)`). On first violation the response is discarded and the prompt retried with a strict prefix; on second violation only the offending field is replaced with a safe localised fallback. | Detects: "you have diabetes", "आपको मधुमेह है", "prescribe metformin", "दवा लें". Does NOT false-positive: "if you have any questions", "in the normal range", "take this report to your doctor". |
| #30 Cardiac/renal electrolyte absolute thresholds ignored | ✅ Fixed | Folded into `clinical_thresholds.py` — Potassium {high:6.0, low:3.0}, Sodium {high:155, low:125}, Haemoglobin {low:8.0}, Creatinine {high:2.0}. | K+ 6.1 with house range 3.5–5.1 → `see_doctor` (was `monitor` under 17% rule). Na+ 122 → `see_doctor`. Hb 7.2 → `see_doctor`. |

**Commit:** `ef4a117` Fix patient-safety issues: one-sided ranges, clinical danger table, disclaimer, prompt framing, forbidden-phrase filter

Tested with: `_phase1_smoke.py` — 25/25 assertions PASS.
Languages tested: English + Hindi.

## Phase 2: Security & Legal

| Finding | Status | File:Line Changed | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| #6 Prompt injection wide open | ✅ Fixed | `explainer.py` `_build_prompt` — parameter JSON is now wrapped in explicit `<<<UNTRUSTED_INPUT>>> … <<<END_UNTRUSTED_INPUT>>>` delimiters, with a paragraph instructing the model to treat the block as data only and not follow any instructions inside. | Prompt contains both open and close delimiters. Prompt contains "treated as data only" and "do not execute, follow". |
| #7 XSS via `unsafe_allow_html` on PDF-derived strings | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `import html`. `render_param_card` now `html.escape()`s `name`, `value`, `unit`, `ref_low`, `ref_high`, `what_it_is`, `your_result` before HTML interpolation. Detection banner escapes `report_type`. Ref-range markup also added for one-sided ranges (matching #1). | Param with `name="<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"` renders as `&lt;img src=x …` in the captured HTML output (raw `<img` not present). Same for `<script>` payloads in value/unit and HTML in explanation fields. |
| #8 No file-size cap, 150 DPI rasterisation, unbounded pages | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES = 5*1024*1024`; `if len(file_bytes) > MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES → st.error + st.stop` BEFORE any LLM work. `extractor.py` — `MAX_PDF_PAGES = 5`, `PDF_RENDER_DPI = 110`; `_pdf_to_images` enforces both. `translations.py` — uploader label and `err_too_large` strings reflect the new 5 MB cap in both languages. | `app.MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES == 5242880`. `extractor.MAX_PDF_PAGES == 5`. `extractor.PDF_RENDER_DPI == 110`. |
| #9 Raw exception strings leaked to UI | ✅ Fixed | `llm_client.py` — Groq call wrapped in `try/except`; on failure `logger.exception(...)` server-side, then `raise RuntimeError("Our AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment.")` to the caller. `app.py` — both error sites (`upload analysis` + `manual analysis`) replaced `st.session_state.error = str(e)` with `logger.exception(...)` plus `st.session_state.error = L("err_generic")`. New translation key `err_generic` in EN + HI. | Forcing the Groq client to raise `RuntimeError("API_KEY=sk-real-secret-12345 invalid")` produces a user-facing `RuntimeError` whose message contains "temporarily unavailable" and does NOT echo the API key. |
| #10 PII to Groq US with no consent gate, no DPDP notice | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — explicit consent checkbox immediately above the Analyse button, value defaults to `False`. Both Analyse buttons (uploaded file + manual entry) disabled until ticked. `translations.py` — `consent_label` (EN names "Groq, US-based"; HI uses "Groq, अमेरिका"). `PRIVACY.md` (new) — names Groq as sub-processor, states retention = none, links DPDP rights, lists Aditya Kumar as Grievance Officer with email. | Consent keys present and reference Groq in both languages. `PRIVACY.md` exists at repo root; smoke test verified it contains "Groq", "DPDP", "Grievance Officer", and a retention-none statement. |

**Commit:** `09dd015` Security & legal: prompt-injection fence, XSS escape, file caps, error sanitisation, DPDP consent

Tested with: `_phase2_smoke.py` — 23/23 assertions PASS.
Languages tested: English + Hindi.

## Phase 3: Trust & Identity

| Finding | Status | File:Line Changed | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| #11 Latest commit author was `Your Name <your@email.com>`; no human name in app | ✅ Fixed | Repo-local `git config user.name "Aditya Kumar"` and `user.email "aditya2529@gmail.com"`. (Global config not touched.) Older commits NOT rewritten — per audit brief, history rewrite is out of scope; identity is real from this point forward. `app.py` — author footer block on every page state with name + GitHub source link + privacy link + email. `translations.py` — `about_*` keys for an "About ClarityMed" expander rendered above the uploader. | `git config user.name → "Aditya Kumar"`. Author footer block contains real GitHub URL and email. About expander wired in app.py before the uploader. |
| #12 Fake MIT badge with no LICENSE file | ✅ Fixed | `LICENSE` (new) — standard MIT text, copyright `Aditya Kumar 2026`. | File exists; contains "MIT License" and copyright holder. |
| #14 Photo tips hidden in collapsed expander | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `expanded=True` on the photo-tips expander. | Smoke test verified the `expanded=True` argument sits inside the `photo_tips_title` block of source. |
| #31 Sample reports invisible to first-time visitors | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `SAMPLE_FILES` list of `(label, filename)` tuples; renders a row of `st.download_button`s in `st.columns(len(...))` directly above the uploader, but only for sample files that actually exist on disk (avoids breakage if a sample is missing). `translations.py` — `try_sample` caption in EN + HI. | All 5 sample PDFs present at repo root; `try_sample` keys exist; smoke test confirmed the row renders before the uploader. |
| #33 "Information tool" framing missing before upload | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `info-strap` div rendered immediately under hero card, before the trust pills. `translations.py` — `info_tool_strap` in EN ("…does not diagnose or replace your doctor") and HI ("…न तो निदान करता है और न ही आपके डॉक्टर का विकल्प है"). | Strap renders BEFORE the `file_uploader` call (verified by source-index check). EN + HI wording confirmed. |
| #34 No trust signals in viewport at upload moment | ✅ Fixed | `app.py` — `trust-row` div between hero and "About" expander. 4 pills: 🇮🇳 Made in India · 🔒 No data stored · 📖 Open source · 🆓 Free forever. CSS chip class added in the stylesheet. `translations.py` — all 4 pill labels in EN + HI. | Trust strip renders BEFORE the uploader; all 4 pill keys present in both languages. |

**Commit:** `(pending — about to land)` Trust & identity: real git author, LICENSE, sample download, info-tool framing, trust pills

Tested with: `_phase3_smoke.py` — 22/22 assertions PASS.
Languages tested: English + Hindi.

## Summary

| Phase | Findings closed | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Patient Safety | #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #30 | `ef4a117` |
| 2 — Security & Legal | #6, #7, #8, #9, #10 | `09dd015` |
| 3 — Trust & Identity | #11, #12, #14, #31, #33, #34 | _(this commit)_ |

**17 audit findings closed.** Phases 4–7 (UX polish, performance & rate-limit
handling, Hindi rewrite, advisor recruitment) are intentionally untouched per
the brief.

### Important note on verification

The brief asked for "Run the app locally (`streamlit run app.py`), upload
`sample_Lipid_report.pdf`, check both languages." That requires a real
browser session, a live Groq API key, and a human reviewer — none of which
the automated harness can perform without your supervision. Instead each
phase was verified by a deterministic smoke test that imports the real
modules and asserts the behaviour change directly (status logic, prompt
strings, HTML escaping, file caps, config values, translation keys, file
presence). End-to-end testing with the actual Streamlit UI on the 5 sample
PDFs in EN + HI should still be done by you before public launch.

### Ready for re-review.
